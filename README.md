From Advanced I added:
1. Use “nice” naming (common readability, self-documenting code);
2. Write safe code, leave no possibility of crashes (correct optionals, array indices handling etc.);
3. Follow any of the architectures (MVP, MVVM etc.);
4. Organize code using clean architecture;
5. Use DI (Koin, Dagger 2 etc);
6. Make the expand/collapse feature for CountriesList animated, with no UI bugs;
